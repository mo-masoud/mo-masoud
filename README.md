# 👋 Hi, I’m Mohamed

I’m a Backend Engineer with strong experience in Laravel and Node.js, currently on a **12–18 month journey to transition into a Senior Software Engineer**.  
This repo documents my learning path, projects, and progress along the way.

## 🚀 Current Focus
- Building strong **Computer Science fundamentals**  
- Practicing **system design and distributed systems**  
- Becoming **framework-agnostic** (beyond Laravel)  
- Developing **portfolio-ready projects**

## 📚 Learning Path
I’m following a structured plan:
- **Phase 1 (Months 1–6):** Foundations → Networking, Data Structures, Databases  
- **Phase 2 (Months 7–12):** Application → Building systems without frameworks, microservices  
- **Phase 3 (Months 13–18):** Advanced → Specialization, production systems, mentoring
